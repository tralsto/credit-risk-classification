# credit-risk-classification

## In this activity, I will use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. The dataset used of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company will be used to builf the model to identify the borrowers' creditworthiness.

## To assess this the model will contain these steps:
###  1. Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
###  2. Create a Logistic Regression Model
###  3. Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report

## After running the model, I have found the prediction of labeling "healthy" loans is much more accurate and reliable than the predicting of the "high-risk" loans. This performance causes a problem as predicting the "high-risk" loans is much more important than predicting the "healthy" loans as the lending company could be giving out loans to borrowers who have bad creditworthiness.
